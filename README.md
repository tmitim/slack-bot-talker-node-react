### SLACK BOT TALKER

Simple messaging form using react/node to have your slack bot talk. Run with the the bots ```SLACK_TOKEN``` as a environment variable.


- written to play with react.
- in real situations, I'd probably make this a terminal app, but I wanted to mess with react

```
SLACK_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxx npm start
```

Go to localhost:3000
